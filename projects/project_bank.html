      <h2>About the BBS Bank</h2>
      <p>
        The Human Dignity Bank is a vision for a radically new kind of financial system —
        one that operates without profit or interest, grounded instead in trust,
        mutual assistance, and human dignity. The goal is to provide support to those
        most in need, regardless of credit score, background, or wealth.

      <h2>Development Status</h2>
      <p>
        The BBS Bank is currently in conceptual and legal design stages.
        Ethical frameworks, eligibility models, and peer-review systems are being co-created
        with social economists, coders, and local communities. We welcome help from
        financial professionals, developers, and anyone with a will to make finance human again.
