      <h2>About the SOS Module</h2>
      <p>
        The SOS module is one of the most critical systems developed by BBS-Core. It allows people to instantly call for help — contacting family, emergency services, or police — even in a state of panic or danger. <br><br>
        The system also includes mobile app support, sound alerts, and automatic location sharing. It is especially useful for people with speech or hearing difficulties.
