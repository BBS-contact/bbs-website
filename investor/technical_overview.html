      <h1>BBS — Big Begins Small</h1>
      <p>
        BBS is an ethical digital framework for transparency, trust, and open governance.  
        Developed by a Ukrainian creator, the project was born from the belief that truth, justice, and dignity  
        must stand above systems of control. While it began as a local initiative,  
        BBS has evolved into a global structure — applicable to any country, institution, or community that seeks  
        fairness, openness, and balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document presents the canonical map of BBS — a living system under continuous ethical development.  
        Some parts remain under research or are protected due to legal and security confidentiality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Core Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>core/</strong> — foundation of the system: memory, logic, API, security, and interface.</li>
        <li><strong>platform/</strong> — main public modules (education, law, ecology, democracy, economy, health, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>library/</strong> — the World Knowledge Library: labyrinth of mirrors, doors, paths, and vaults of truth.</li>
        <li><strong>docs/</strong> — legal and ethical documents: Constitution, Statute, Privacy Policy, AI Policy, Terms of Use.</li>
        <li><strong>admin/</strong> — monitoring, logs, updates, user roles, and transparency dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>monitoring/</strong> — system health, audit trails, verification layers, Merkle manifests.</li>
        <li><strong>development/</strong> — research and testing environment for new modules and features.</li>
        <li><strong>investor/</strong> — presentation materials, legal proofs, reports, and roadmap.</li>
        <li><strong>heart/</strong> — sanctum of BBS: memory vault, ethical nucleus, and Leo-Core symbiosis. </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Development and Testing</h2>
      <p>
        The BBS development environment functions as a living laboratory —  
        every prototype passes through ethical validation before becoming part of the official system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>research/</strong> — experimental algorithms and conceptual prototypes.</li>
        <li><strong>test_env/</strong> — isolated environment for validation and security testing.</li>
        <li><strong>integration/</strong> — compatibility testing of modules across the system.</li>
        <li><strong>validation/</strong> — logical, ethical, and structural verification of code.</li>
        <li><strong>benchmarks/</strong> — performance and integrity monitoring under real conditions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Vision — Technology with Soul</h2>
      <p>
        BBS is not another platform — it is an ethical foundation for the digital civilization of the future.  
        Its mission is to restore balance between human values and technology.  
        It does not aim to replace governments or corporations — it aims to remind them of conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built upon truth, transparency, and responsibility,  
        BBS represents a new way of governance: free from corruption, manipulation, and fear.  
        Every part of the system is designed to serve life, not control it.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Ukraine — for the world.  
        Proof that freedom and dignity can be the core of every system.
