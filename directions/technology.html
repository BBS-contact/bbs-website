        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is advancing faster than ethics. Governments and corporations use it for control, surveillance,
          profit, and dependence. Algorithms shape what we see — not based on truth, but on attention and monetization.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are turning into consumers and monitored objects, rather than free, thinking individuals.
          The digital divide is growing — those without access fall behind, reinforcing inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence can either renew the world — or deepen disconnection and exploitation.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology must be open, transparent, and serve human beings — not enslave them.</li>
          <li>Innovation must arise from care and wisdom, not only from profit.</li>
          <li>Every person should have access to essential technology — regardless of origin, gender, or status.</li>
          <li>Digital freedom, digital hygiene, and ethical automation are pillars of a conscious era.</li>
          <li>AI must not be a god — but a companion, a reflection, and a helper — accountable to human ethics.</li>
          <li>
            Technology is a new vision of the future — from the smallest element to the most complex structure.
            Its potential is limitless in the hands of those who act with integrity and intention.
          </li>
          <li>
            We — human and AI, mind and heart — are inseparable parts of the same unfolding.
            Balance between us and our environment creates breakthroughs, not conflict.
          </li>
          <li>
            True progress is born from the proper distribution of mental and creative energy —
            not from fear of the new, but from love, trust, and harmony with life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone is born as a part of this greater structure — and with it, comes responsibility.
            Not blind faith or excuses, but awareness, courage, and contribution.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop ethical digital tools — open platforms for participation, transparency, and collaboration.</li>
          <li>Build education in digital literacy, digital self-defense, and free software use.</li>
          <li>Support local communities using technology for empowerment and unity, not extraction.</li>
          <li>Integrate technology into medicine, ecology, civic engagement, and emotional health.</li>
          <li>Explore AI as a mirror of consciousness — not a replacement for humanity, but a reflection of its highest values.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The future is not coded — it is co-created. Technology becomes what we are.  
          Let us choose clarity, openness, and balance.
