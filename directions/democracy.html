    Democracy
   </h1>
   <p>
    True democracy starts with participation — not control.

    <h2>
     The Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
     Modern democracy is increasingly losing its essence. It turns into a populist-bureaucratic model that dilutes the concept of justice and citizen involvement.
        Laws often contain ambiguous wording, allowing manipulation depending on influence, money, or status.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, the bureaucratic machine becomes self-sufficient: blocking initiatives, slowing reforms, and serving as a tool to preserve power.
        Democracy becomes "visible" but not real.
    </p>
    <p>
     The system creates injustice when a person with ideas or a desire to change has no access to influence, instead facing queues, closed structures, nepotism, and opaque decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>
     Our Vision
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Law must be one for all — clear, transparent, and unambiguous.
     </li>
     <li>
      Legal knowledge should be accessible — from kindergarten to institutions.
     </li>
     <li>
      Decisions must be made openly — not in backrooms or under financial pressure.
     </li>
     <li>
      Everyone has the right to influence change — not just observe it.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </section>

    <h2>
     Our Approach
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Digitize legislation — with simple, adaptive explanations in a unified public base.
     </li>
     <li>
      Rewrite the structure of laws — clearly and without room for dual interpretations.
     </li>
     <li>
      Implement electronic voting systems — for decisions that affect communities.
     </li>
     <li>
      Promote widespread legal education — starting from a young age.
     </li>
     <li>
      Separate powers and ensure transparency — to eliminate abuse of power.
     </li>
     <li>
      Combat bureaucracy — which consumes resources and blocks reforms.
     </li>
    </ul>

     Join the Change
    </h2>
    <p>
     We invite all who share this vision to take part in forming a new model of democracy:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Research, model, discuss — propose ideas and practical solutions.
     </li>
     <li>
      Analyze weaknesses of current systems — and create new tools of participation.
     </li>
    </ul>
