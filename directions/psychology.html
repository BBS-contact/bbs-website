        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health is still a taboo or misunderstood topic in many cultures.
          People are afraid to ask for help or see it as a weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stress, anxiety, burnout, and depression have become the "new normal".
          In many countries, there is no access to quality psychological support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychology is often reduced to commercial coaching or superficial advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is still not recognized as a full method of treatment without medication —
          despite the clear evidence that most illnesses have emotional or psychosomatic origins.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are not taught to manage emotions, so pain accumulates inside.
          Psychological support is often expensive and unavailable to those who need it most.
          Meanwhile, manipulative "gurus" exploit emotional vulnerability.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Psychology must be a free, accessible tool of support — from children to adults.</li>
          <li>It must never be manipulative — only a space for healing and understanding.</li>
          <li>Emotional literacy should be part of early education.</li>
          <li>Psychology is not a luxury, but a core part of a healthy society.</li>
          <li>To ask for help is not weakness — it's the strength to be real.</li>
          <li>Learning to manage emotions leads to happiness — and happiness heals and extends life.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <p>
          Being vulnerable is not shame — it’s a gift.  
          Only those who face their shadow can bring light to others.
