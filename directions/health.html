      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Modern healthcare is focused mostly on treating symptoms, not root causes.
        Many systems have become businesses where the patient is a "client".
      </p>
      <p>
        People wait in line for years just to receive basic treatment.
        The medical system is buried in bureaucratic paperwork and formalities —
        wasting precious time and resources on forms instead of care.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a growing shortage of qualified specialists and nurses,
        and their work is increasingly undervalued and underpaid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hospitals are often staffed by so-called “doctor-businessmen” —
        more concerned with their income than the health of patients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Healing the patient becomes unprofitable —  
        so many are left chronically ill just to keep them in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads to deliberate negligence and systemic dependency.
        There is almost no accountability for medical professionals at any level.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Medicine must be open, humane, and based on partnership.</li>
        <li>The doctor and patient should be a team — not hierarchy.</li>
        <li>We must treat the whole person — body, soul, and context.</li>
        <li>Medical knowledge should be unified, global, and understandable.</li>
        <li>We must not suppress illness — but understand, track, and prevent it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h2>Mental Health Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is not separate from physical health — it is its foundation.
        Emotional well-being, psychological safety, and human connection are all part of true healing.
