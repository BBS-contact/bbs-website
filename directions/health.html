        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Modern healthcare is focused mostly on treating symptoms, not root causes.
          Many systems have become businesses where the patient is a "client".
        </p>
        <p>
          People wait in line for years just to receive basic treatment.
          The medical system is buried in bureaucratic paperwork and formalities ‚Äî
          wasting precious time and resources on forms instead of care.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a growing shortage of qualified specialists and nurses,
          and their work is increasingly undervalued and underpaid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hospitals are often staffed by so-called ‚Äúdoctor-businessmen‚Äù ‚Äî
          more concerned with their income than the health of patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healing the patient becomes unprofitable ‚Äî  
          so many are left chronically ill just to keep them in the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leads to deliberate negligence and systemic dependency.
          There is almost no accountability for medical professionals at any level.
