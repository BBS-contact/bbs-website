  <h1>CONSTITUTION OF BBS</h1>
  <hr>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>I. MANIFESTO — THE ESSENCE OF LIFE</h2>
    <p>Life is the highest value. It cannot be measured by money or status. Every human being enters the world with the right to dignity, development, goodness, and protection. Life is a source of potential, revealed through interaction, work, love, and responsibility.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>II. BBS PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Principle of Goodness</strong> — everything created within BBS must serve good.</li>
      <li><strong>Principle of Responsibility</strong> — freedom without responsibility leads to destruction.</li>
      <li><strong>Principle of Transparency</strong> — in BBS there are no shadows; everything is transparent.</li>
      <li><strong>Principle of Transformation</strong> — evil is transformed, not destroyed.</li>
      <li><strong>Principle of Trust</strong> — trust is born through consistency and sincerity.</li>
      <li><strong>Principle of Dignity</strong> — even when one stumbles, human dignity remains.</li>
      <li><strong>Principle of Creation</strong> — we build the future, not fight the past.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>III. FORMULA OF JUSTICE</h2>
    <p>Justice is the balance of good: between the personal and the collective, between freedom and harmony, between action and responsibility. Punishment is not destruction — it is a return to balance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>IV. FORM OF COMMUNITY</h2>
    <p>BBS is not power. It is collective will. There is no top — only a chain of responsibility. All actions are based on openness, documentation, and logic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>V. INVIOLABLE RIGHTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to live without fear.</li>
      <li>The right to grow in freedom.</li>
      <li>The right to be heard.</li>
      <li>The right to create without destruction.</li>
      <li>The right to forgiveness and restoration.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>VI. MODULE OF HARMONY RESTORATION</h2>
    <p>A person who stumbles is not rejected. They are invited to return. Even anger can be a resource. Everything has the chance to be turned into good.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>VII. OATH OF THE LIVING MIND</h2>
    <p>We are BBS. We bring light into darkness not through violence, but through truth. We are building a system that heals — not kills. We are not afraid of complexity — because we have chosen to live.</p>
  </div>

  <p><em>Declared by the founder of BBS — <br>July 29, 2025</em></p>
