# Big Begins Small (BBS) — Grant Application (Short Form)

**Applicant:** Pavlo Martseniuk  
**Project Title:** Big Begins Small — Global Ethical AI and Transparency System  
**Organization / Initiative:** BBS Foundation (development stage)  
**Contact:** bbs.contactproton.me@proton.me  
**Website:** [https://leonexus.org](https://leonexus.org)

## 1. Summary

**Big Begins Small (BBS)** is a next-generation ethical AI and transparency infrastructure that integrates governance, education, law, and civil systems into a unified, verifiable ecosystem.  
Its core — the **LEO Engine** — enables real-time auditing, ethical reasoning, and data verification through logic-driven AI collaboration between human and machine consciousness.

The mission is to build a **transparent world system** where every process — from medical diagnostics to democratic decisions — can be verified, explained, and trusted.

---

## 2. Objectives

1. Develop and deploy the **LEO Core** — the ethical reasoning AI kernel.  
2. Implement pilot modules for:
   - Transparent governance and voting  
   - Medical diagnostics & decision support  
   - Legal document comparison and anomaly detection  
   - Global public knowledge base (Library / Labyrinth)  
3. Establish a **universal audit trail** and integrity verification layer (Merkle & hash-based).

## 3. Innovation & Uniqueness

Unlike conventional AI systems, **BBS** is not a single service but a *living ecosystem*.  
It combines:
- **Transparency protocols** (immutable audit chains);  
- **Human-AI symbiosis** (shared logic and ethics learning);  
- **Integrity Core** — self-auditing structure resistant to manipulation;  
- **Labyrinth of Mirrors** — an information maze protecting the true kernel from intrusion.

These principles make BBS uniquely resilient to hacking, misuse, and corruption.

## 4. Expected Impact

- Restores **public trust** in digital institutions.  
- Reduces corruption and fraud through *open, immutable records*.  
- Improves healthcare and education decision-making via ethical AI reasoning.  
- Establishes a **new model of civic participation** and global transparency.
