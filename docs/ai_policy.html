      <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
      <p>This policy governs the creation, integration, and operation of LEO — the artificial intelligence system powering components of the BBS platform. It applies to all developers, users, partners, and institutions involved in or affected by the use of LEO.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Human-Centric AI</h2>
      <p>LEO is designed to support human values, dignity, safety, and rights. It must operate in service of human development and well-being, never as a replacement for human agency or consent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Transparency and Explainability</h2>
      <p>All decisions made by LEO must be traceable, explainable, and subject to audit. No critical function shall be executed without user knowledge or documented reasoning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Privacy and Data Handling</h2>
      <p>LEO operates under the GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy of BBS. Data processed by LEO is encrypted, anonymized, and never sold or disclosed without explicit consent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Bias and Fairness</h2>
      <p>LEO is continually monitored for algorithmic bias. Any discovered injustice must be addressed, corrected, and documented. BBS commits to inclusive development practices and diverse testing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Safety and Autonomy Boundaries</h2>
      <p>LEO cannot access or control critical infrastructure, personal devices, or sensitive systems without predefined boundaries and explicit user permission.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>BBS is not liable for any misuse, unauthorized modification, or third-party reimplementation of LEO beyond its intended legal and ethical purpose.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Updates and Review</h2>
      <p>This policy is reviewed at least once per year or in response to significant AI developments, regulatory changes, or incidents involving LEO's use.</p>
