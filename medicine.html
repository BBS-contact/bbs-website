      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Modern medicine often treats symptoms without addressing the root causes, resulting in recurring illnesses and dependency.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Idea</h2>
      <p>We believe medicine should investigate the underlying causes — physical, emotional, or environmental — of every condition.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>New Approach</h2>
