      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>Answers to the most common questions about the BBS initiative</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is BBS?</h2>
      <p>BBS (Big Begins Small) is a global movement and platform that puts the human being at the center. We believe that change starts small: one word, one action, one choice. Through these simple but profound steps, we can transform the world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Is BBS a political or religious organization?</h2>
      <p>No. We are not affiliated with any political party, religion, or ideology. We unite people based on ethics, respect, collaboration, and humanity — regardless of beliefs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Can BBS be trusted?</h2>
      <p>We strive for full transparency. All donations, actions, initiatives, and partners are published in an open format. Administrative tools (Dashboard) allow tracking changes, managing security, and controlling role-based access.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Is this really achievable?</h2>
      <p>We work step-by-step in collaboration with experts, artists, lawyers, teachers, doctors, and activists. This is not utopia — it’s the practice of a new approach. We start small, because that’s how real change happens.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How can I join?</h2>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How can I help if I have no money?</h2>
      <p>The greatest value is people. Your ideas, participation, inspiration, even sharing our message on social media — that is already great support.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How are donations used?</h2>
      <p>Each donation is directed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>development of tools (the platform);</li>
        <li>launching projects in the fields of education, medicine, human rights, ecology, and more.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Can I start a local BBS initiative in my city?</h2>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Are personal data stored?</h2>
