      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Modern democracy is increasingly losing its essence. It turns into a populist-bureaucratic model that dilutes the concept of justice and citizen involvement.
        Laws often contain ambiguous wording, allowing manipulation depending on influence, money, or status.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the bureaucratic machine becomes self-sufficient: blocking initiatives, slowing reforms, and serving as a tool to preserve power.
        Democracy becomes "visible" but not real.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system creates injustice when a person with ideas or a desire to change has no access to influence, instead facing queues, closed structures, nepotism, and opaque decisions.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Law must be one for all — clear, transparent, and unambiguous.</li>
        <li>Legal knowledge should be accessible — from kindergarten to institutions.</li>
        <li>Decisions must be made openly — not in backrooms or under financial pressure.</li>
        <li>Everyone has the right to influence change — not just observe it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Digitize legislation — with simple, adaptive explanations in a unified public base.</li>
        <li>Rewrite the structure of laws — clearly and without room for dual interpretations.</li>
        <li>Implement electronic voting systems — for decisions that affect communities.</li>
        <li>Promote widespread legal education — starting from a young age.</li>
        <li>Separate powers and ensure transparency — to eliminate abuse of power.</li>
        <li>Combat bureaucracy — which consumes resources and blocks reforms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Join the Change</h2>
      <p>We invite all who share this vision to take part in forming a new model of democracy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Research, model, discuss — propose ideas and practical solutions.</li>
        <li>Analyze weaknesses of current systems — and create new tools of participation.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>You don't have to be a politician to build a just system. You have to be human.</blockquote>
