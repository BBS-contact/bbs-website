        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Nature is degrading faster than humanity can even comprehend the consequences.
          Pollution of air, water, and soil has become the norm, not the exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are used to consuming without thinking about the source or the outcome.
          Corporations and governments often ignore ecological risks in pursuit of profit.
          Ecology is seen as a “topic for activists” — not a shared, daily responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The natural system is designed in such a way that if humans parasitize it, it removes and erases them. This is a billion-year mechanism.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          What we now face is a massive ecological imbalance: uncontrolled resource usage and blind modernization are leading civilization toward self-destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          One may profit from excessive consumption, but all suffer — even those unaware that their environment has been exploited from the other side of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Earth has balance. And I fear it may start erasing entire continents, not out of vengeance, but as an automatic act of equilibrium. As if it had consciousness — but in fact, it's natural balancing.</em>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Ecology is not about restriction — it is about wise choice.</li>
          <li>Humans are not above nature — they are part of it.</li>
          <li>Balance means <strong>equal attention to consumption and restoration</strong>.</li>
          <li>Resources are a <strong>responsibility</strong>, not a right.</li>
          <li>Society must think long-term — not only about profit, but about consequences.</li>
          <li>Ecology is part of <strong>education, health, agriculture, and technology</strong>.</li>
          <li>Our goal is to create a <strong>balanced transition and fusion with nature</strong>.</li>
          <li>Nature holds <strong>infinite, eternal resources</strong> — but only for those who live with it, not over it.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Support local actions: cleanup, sorting, greening, preservation.</li>
          <li>Create open digital maps of ecological health by region.</li>
          <li>Promote ecological thinking through education, community, and example.</li>
          <li>Increase transparency in resource use: water, energy, land.</li>
          <li>Promote circular economy — where nothing is wasted without purpose.</li>
          <li>Encourage ethical consumption, green building, clean energy.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Join the Change</h2>
        <p>
          Even the smallest ecological actions matter.  
          Because the Earth begins with you.
