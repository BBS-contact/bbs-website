# BBS — Big Begins Small  
Ethical Digital Framework for Transparency, Knowledge, and Human Dignity

BBS is a living system that merges technology with conscience.  
It was created by a Ukrainian founder as an open, ethical foundation for transparent governance,  
responsible AI, and free access to verified knowledge.  
The project began as a local initiative in Ukraine and evolved into a global model  
for fair and decentralized decision-making.

## About the Project

a transparent platform that connects people, institutions, and AI  
in a system based on truth, fairness, and human dignity.

Core values:
- Truth over form  
- Person over system  
- Freedom from manipulation  
- Responsibility over fear  
- Love without coercion  

BBS combines legal transparency, knowledge organization, digital ethics, and AI responsibility  
into one coherent system — a foundation for the civilization of the future.
