      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Modern education systems often prioritize memorization and conformity
        over critical thinking, creativity, and the individual potential of each learner.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Idea</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in a human-centered approach to education â€” one that uncovers,
        supports, and develops the natural abilities, passions, and uniqueness
        of each person from early age through lifelong learning.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>New Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision includes personalized learning paths, emotional development,
        creative exploration, and digital tools that adapt to each student rather
        than forcing them to fit outdated standards.
